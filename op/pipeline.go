//Rounds a number to a whole integer or to a specified decimal place.
//$rtrim
//Removes whitespace or the specified characters from the end of a string.
//$sampleRate
//Randomly select documents at a given rate. Although the exact number of documents selected varies on each run, the quantity chosen approximates the sample rate expressed as a percentage of the total number of documents.
//
//New in version 4.4.2.
//
//$second
//Returns the seconds for a date as a number between 0 and 60 (leap seconds).
//$setDifference
//Returns a set with elements that appear in the first set but not in the second set; i.e. performs a relative complement of the second set relative to the first. Accepts exactly two argument expressions.
//$setEquals
//Returns true if the input sets have the same distinct elements. Accepts two or more argument expressions.
//$setIntersection
//Returns a set with elements that appear in all of the input sets. Accepts any number of argument expressions.
//$setIsSubset
//Returns true if all elements of the first set appear in the second set, including when the first set equals the second set; i.e. not a strict subset. Accepts exactly two argument expressions.
//$setUnion
//Returns a set with elements that appear in any of the input sets.
//$size
//Returns the number of elements in the array. Accepts a single expression as argument.
//$sin
//Returns the sine of a value that is measured in radians.
//$sinh
//Returns the hyperbolic sine of a value that is measured in radians.
//$slice
//Returns a subset of an array.
//$split
//Splits a string into substrings based on a delimiter. Returns an array of substrings. If the delimiter is not found within the string, returns an array containing the original string.
//$sqrt
//Calculates the square root.
//$stdDevPop
//Returns the population standard deviation of the input values.
//
//Changed in version 3.2: Available in both $group and $project stages.
//
//$stdDevSamp
//Returns the sample standard deviation of the input values.
//
//Changed in version 3.2: Available in both $group and $project stages.
//
//$strcasecmp
//Performs case-insensitive string comparison and returns: 0 if two strings are equivalent, 1 if the first string is greater than the second, and -1 if the first string is less than the second.
//$strLenBytes
//Returns the number of UTF-8 encoded bytes in a string.
//$strLenCP
//Returns the number of UTF-8 code points in a string.
//$substr
//Deprecated. Use $substrBytes or $substrCP.
//$substrBytes
//Returns the substring of a string. Starts with the character at the specified UTF-8 byte index (zero-based) in the string and continues for the specified number of bytes.
//$substrCP
//Returns the substring of a string. Starts with the character at the specified UTF-8 code point (CP) index (zero-based) in the string and continues for the number of code points specified.
//$subtract
//Returns the result of subtracting the second value from the first. If the two values are numbers, return the difference. If the two values are dates, return the difference in milliseconds. If the two values are a date and a number in milliseconds, return the resulting date. Accepts two argument expressions. If the two values are a date and a number, specify the date argument first as it is not meaningful to subtract a date from a number.
//$sum
//Returns a sum of numerical values. Ignores non-numeric values.
//
//Changed in version 3.2: Available in both $group and $project stages.
//
//$switch
//Evaluates a series of case expressions. When it finds an expression which evaluates to true, $switch executes a specified expression and breaks out of the control flow.
//$tan
//Returns the tangent of a value that is measured in radians.
//$tanh
//Returns the hyperbolic tangent of a value that is measured in radians.
//$toBool
//Converts value to a boolean.
//$toDate
//Converts value to a Date.
//$toDecimal
//Converts value to a Decimal128.
//$toDouble
//Converts value to a double.
//$toInt
//Converts value to an integer.
//$toLong
//Converts value to a long.
//$toObjectId
//Converts value to an ObjectId.
//$toString
//Converts value to a string.
//$toLower
//Converts a string to lowercase. Accepts a single argument expression.
//$toUpper
//Converts a string to uppercase. Accepts a single argument expression.
//$trim
//Removes whitespace or the specified characters from the beginning and end of a string.
//$trunc
//Truncates a number to a whole integer or to a specified decimal place.
//$type
//Return the BSON data type of the field.
//$week
//Returns the week number for a date as a number between 0 (the partial week that precedes the first Sunday of the year) and 53 (leap year).
//$year
//Returns the year for a date as a number (e.g. 2014).
//$zip
//Merge two arrays together.
